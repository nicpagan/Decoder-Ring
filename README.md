## Basic Functionality:
An application that would encode or decode messages. There are three different encoder/decoder options.

1.  Caesar Cypher: Will move however many letters you specify. If encode is true, it will encode the message. Ex: "random", with 3, encode = true: "udqgrp". If encode is false, it will decode the message. Ex: "udqgrp" with -3, encode = false: "random".
    
2.  Substitution: Allows user to make their own alphabet to substitute the regular alphabet. Ex: "QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM" would replace "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
    
3.  Polybius: Allows user to encode using a polybius square. Look up polybius for more information.


## Challenge:

This project pushed me outside of my comfort zone and tested my ability to develop complex algorithms for the Caesar Shift, Polyibus Square, and Substitution Ciper. I was then able to apply my knowledge of unit testing with Mocha and Chai. I needed to write the necessary tests in order to test my algorithms. An additional requirement was to use the expect() method to test my code.
